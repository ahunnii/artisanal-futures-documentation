# Welcome to Artisanal Futures!

Thank you for your interest in the Artisanal Futures platform. We work with Detroit's small “mom and pop” sized businesses, as well as larger
scale worker-owned companies, worker collectives and cooperatives. Places like urban farms, public makerspaces and the like are included as well,
because they align with the goals of community benefit, sustainability and civic engagement. If you are not sure if you qualify, you can read more
about the definition, and submit an inquiry, on this page.

The “big picture” goal is to replace the extractive economy of big corporations, who put the lion's share in their own pockets, with a community-based
economy that returns value to those who generate it. For businesses, the Artisanal Futures platform provides collaboration tools: for example,
linking local supply chains such as farms and restaurants, or sharing access to AI or other technologies. For the public, it provides a marketplace
where consumers are buying locally, saving money by buying in bulk, sharing knowledge, and engaging in other civic activities that might improve
education and environments and even feed back into our business participants. Thus, it is a vision for the transition to a decolonized circular economy.

We do not charge any fees or handle any transactions. Customers can search for your products or services on the platform, but they will be
redirected to your website for making any online purchase.
