# Artisan Sites

As a part of being a part of AF early on, we offer the ability to create an e-commerce site for the artisans who need it. With our current staff, there is
a waitlist for the artisans to get their site up and running. We are working on a solution to this problem.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

Initially, we were planning on using just WordPress to create every site. However, we have decided to use Next.js
for the front-end and WordPress for a Headless CMS. This will allow us to create a more custom experience for the artisans and also
allow us to use the latest and greatest technologies.

PlanetScale is the database we are using for each of the sites. Chosen for its scalability and ease of use.
