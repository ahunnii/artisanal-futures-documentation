# Getting Started

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Currently, we are only offering this application to our existing artisans. Check back soon for updates!

Navigate to the [Solidarity Pathways application](https://artisanalfutures/tools/solidarity-pathways) and sign in with your credentials.

## Creating a Depot

Depots are how artisans manage their drivers, customers, and route plans. Each depot has:

- A name
- A magic code which allows drivers to access the generated route plans
- A depot address

![Hello](/create-depot.png)

You are able to skip this step and head straight into the sandbox mode to try out the application and generate your routes via a CSV.

## New Users

New users are welcomed to the onboarding page. From here, you are able to upload your drivers, customers, and
stops as well as create a route on any specific day. You can also just skip this step and create a new route manually.

## Adding drivers

You are able to add drivers to your depot. Each driver then can be added to a route. You can upload a CSV file of your drivers
with their default values or add them manually. Check out the [CSV template](/driver-template.csv) for the correct format.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Drivers need an email and phone number in order to be saved to the depot
</Callout>

## Adding stops and clients

You are able to create a new route by manually adding stops or uploading them. Check out the [CSV template](/job-template.csv) for the correct format.

	If you add your client's info to the stop, they will be automatically saved to depot if they are not already in the
	depot.
</Callout>

## Creating a route

When creating a route, you need to have at least a driver and some stops. If you missed adding a driver or stops,
you can add them on the route page as well. You can also add previous stops to the route if you missed them.

![Routing Page](/routing.png)

If you are trying to find a specific stop, you are able to search for them from within the route.

For both drivers and stops, you are able to manage your existing drivers and stops from the route page. Any changes
made will only be reflected on the route and not the depot unless you specify to update the depot info and defaults as well.

![Manage Drivers](/manage-drivers.png)

Same for creating, you can just add to the existing route, or save to the depot for future use.
![Create Drivers](/create-drivers.png)

Once you add your drivers and stops, you are able to generate the route. The route will be generated based on what
each driver's threshold is and the stops that are available. Make sure to double check the driver and stops before
generating.

![Draft](/draft-route.png)

You are now left with optimized routing paths for your drivers. You can send them directly to the drivers, make modifications
to the stops that didn't quite make it into the route, or monitor the progess of the paths once they are initiated by
the driver.
