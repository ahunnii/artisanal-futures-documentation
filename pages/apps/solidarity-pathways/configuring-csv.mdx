# Configuring Your CSV File

With Solidarity Pathways, you are able to upload your data via a CSV spreadsheet.

## Driver Table

If you have repeated drivers, you are able to save them to your depot. This will allow you to select them from a dropdown list when you are creating a new route.

Each driver has a set of defaults that you can also set within the CSV file. Below are the headers you can use to configure your drivers.

| Column Header | Description        | Examples |  d  |
| ------------- | :----------------- | -------: | :-: |
| driver_name   | Who is the driver? |        3 |  4  |
| 5             | 6                  |        7 |  8  |
