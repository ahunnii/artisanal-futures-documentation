# Drivers & Vehicles

In Solidarity Pathways, we use driver and vehicle information to help us better calculate the
most optimal path.

**Drivers** are the people who drive the vehicles. They have a name, a phone number to text them
updates and new routes, an email, and a default address.

**Vehicles** are the driver's stats used to calculate which driver can take which route.
These have a starting and ending location, max number of stops, max distance, max travel time,
the start of the workday, and the end of the workday, as well as breaks.

Each driver has a vehicle default. These values are used when adding the driver to the routing plan.

- You are able to update the driver's personal information: **INSERT WHERE HERE**
- You are able to update the driver's default values: **INSERT WHERE HERE**

Each vehicle associated with a routing plan NEEDS a driver. This is so you can send out updates to the driver
when the route changes, or when the driver needs to be notified of a new route, as well as keeping track of the current route
via messaging in app.

When uploading a driver's CSV, you are able to specify the driver's defaults as well. If you decide to not specify the driver's defaults,
we will use the following defaults for the driver:

- Max number of stops: 10
- Max distance: 100 miles
- Max travel time: 8 hours
- Start of workday: 8:00 AM
- End of workday: 5:00 PM
- Breaks: 1 hour

When uploading a vehicle's CSV, you are able to specify the vehicle's defaults as well. If you decide to not specify the vehicle's defaults,

## Developer Notes

TODO List:

- [ ] Add the ability to assign default values to new driver CSV uploads if none are provided
- [ ] Add ability to reassign a driver to a vehicle
- [ ] Add ability to add a 'temp driver status' to a vehicle when a driver is deleted
