# Jobs & Clients

We use jobs to represent the individual stops needing to be done within a route plan. Each job
has the option to assign a client to it. This allows you to quickly track client history for later.

**Jobs** ae the individual (deliveries, pickups, maintainence, administrative ) that need to be made in a route plan.
These include the time window in which the job needs to be done, the location, the prep time, the service time, and the priority.

**Clients** are the people or businesses that the jobs are being done for. You can assign multiple jobs to a client, or none at all.
Clients have a name, default address, a phone number, and an email (required).

When uploading a stop CSV file, you can assign a client to the stop by adding the email address of the saved client.
If you don't have a client saved with that email, you will be prompted to create a new client with that email.

When uploading a client CSV file, you can assign a default job to the client by adding the details in addition to the basic
client info.

If you have the name of the client and email in the stop csv, it automatically assigns or creates the client.

- Client csv with job info (Creates new clients and assigns a default job to the client)
- Client csv without job info (Creates new clients)
- Stop csv with client email (Assigns the client to the stop)
- Stop csv with client email and name (Creates new clients and assigns the client to the stop)
